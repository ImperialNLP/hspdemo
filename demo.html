Honey will dry out the bacteria on the skin and clean the pores while also moisturizing the skin deeply and reduce fat production.\n\nIngredients: Half a cup of milk, 2 tablespoons of honey, 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice\n\nMix all of these ingredients very well. Clean your face and apply the mixture onto cleansed face with a cotton pad. Let it sit on your face for 20 minutes and rinse it with warm water. If you feel tightness on your skin, you can apply a light coat of moisturizer. To completely get rid of acne, apply this mask at home three times a week.", "title": "What type of acne is this and what can I do to clear it up?", "image": "https://i.redd.it/hguixrkdv7c31.jpg"}, "1d":  {"text": "No stuttering on my behalf.
